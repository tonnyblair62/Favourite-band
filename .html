              <p><strong>H_ART THE BAND </strong> is a band of three versitile members;Mordecai,Wachira and Kenneth who ave defied all odds against them to be labelled as one of the best bands in Kenya and East Africa. With time, they have artistically flourished into a revolutionary force not only in their musical poetic presentation but also in their conspicuously fashionable sense of futuristic style.Meeting in the corridors of their acting careers at the Kenya national theatre in late 2012, the three discovered that they share a similar passion for music, spoken word/poetry, fashion and arts in general. Not long after H_ART the BAND was formed.</p>
